# MindMap
Mind mapping program written in Python3 with Tkinter... Because who doesn't love mind maps?

Currently only designed to work with Linux-based systems.

The best thing to do to start out is run the wrapper and read the help sheet: `python3 wrapper.py`

If you know what sheet you want to open, you can also run (for example): `python3 mindmap.py Sheets/help.json`

To create your own sheet, run wrapper and click the '+' tile. Then type in the name of the new sheet. A file will be created when you save that sheet (Ctrl-s).
